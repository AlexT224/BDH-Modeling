Negroes on campus
Integration at College Park
By HOLLACE GOLDBERG
Second in a series
The Negro's advance into the University
was slow, but in the 1950's his pace quick­
ened. Parren J. Mitchell, aNegro gradu­
ate student in sociology, had applied to the
University in August of 1950. Mitchell was
accepted with the tacit understanding that
he attend classes in Baltimore--not in
College Park.
These “regrettable* situations came
to a close in the early fifties. Slowly,
the Board of Regents and the Supreme
Court passed holdings liberalizing edu­
cation facilities.
In May of 1954, theU.S. Supreme Court
struck down the ‘‘separate but equal,r
doctrine and held that public education
institutions must be Integrated (Brown
v. Board of Education). The following
month the Board of Regents unanimously
passed the motion that "all qualified stu­
dents resident of Maryland may apply
for admission to the University In all
of Its schools.*
In 1955, following the embarrassing
incident with the D.C. Recreation Depart­
ment, the Board moved to extend the
non-racial policy to out-of-state appli­
cants.
The University at last had an Integrated
admissions policy. It was twenty years
since Donald Gaines Murray had appealed
his case for admission to the University
Law School. It was four years since a
Negro student had entered College park.
Now that the policy gates had opened,
how was integration effected within the
College park campus? Integration was a
reality on paper, but socially and ad­
ministratively the Negro was still feeling
his way. The Negro and the fourteenth
amendment were yet to expand.
The conclusion was “yes, there ought
to be discussion,” The Court ruled in
Mitchell’s favor, declaring that “counsel
shows certain advantages in studying at
College park. . .weekly seminars are
more profitable in large classes."
While Mitchell set to work for his
Masters degree a State investigative
body, the Weglein Commission, looked
into “Negro Higher Education in the
State.” Finding a wide disparity between
Negro and white educational facilities,
the Committee proposed that the “State
admit Negroes to graduate and profes­
sional schools when it was impractical
to offer equal education opportunities at
separate Negro institutions."
The State’s last-minute programs to
step up separate Negro education facili­
ties apparently were not advancing fast
enough to combat the drive toward inte­
gration. The Board of Regents examined
the Weglein recommendations and in
April, 1951, the Board promulgated a new
racial policy:
In the future all resident applicants
within the state, regardless of race, color
or creed, were to be considered for
admission to the professional schools
in Baltimore on an equal basis with
white applicants.
In line with this policy ruling, in
May of that year, two Negroes were ad­
mitted to the Medical School, an institu­
tion that had been white for 144 years.
The new integration policy ran smooth­
ly for several months, until another
hassle arose in July, 1952. Wendall A.
Paris, assistant athletic director to the
D.C. Public Schools and a Negro, waS'
denied admission to a summer school
graduate course in College park.
The University apologized to Paris,
but Informed that the school’s policy of
accepting Negro students did not apply
to out-of-state applicants. If Paris had
been white, he would have been accepted.
In 1955 a similar incident occurred.
The University had Invited members of
the D.C. Recreation Department to take
a summer course at College park. Ten
workers applied. All were Initially ac­
cepted.
However, six of these applications
were from Negroes, and when the Uni­
versity administration realized this,
those applicants were rejected. They
were returned their money and Informed
that the school did not admit out-of-state
Negroes.
In protest, the Recreation Superintend­
ent withdrew the four other white appli­
cants.
The Board of Regents, commenting
on the incident, said that the situation
was “regrettable." The Board would
make efforts to negotiate for such
a course for D.C. employees within the
District.
•We hadn’t accepted Negroes before,
but there wasn’t anything the matter with
this application," recalls Harold
(Continued from page 1)
Hoffsomer, former head of the
Department of Sociology.
“The President (Byrd) said our
policy was to give them equal
opportunities. We would give
them chances to get their educa­
tion, but we wouldn't do it on the
campus in College Park.*
“This man wanted to major In
sociology,* continued Hoffsomar,
•and I told President Byrd at the
time that one of the required
courses in sociology was my
methods in sociological research
and that course wasn’t given in
Baltimore.*
He further told Byrd that, “if
we wanted to make things equal...
I would have to give the course
myself. I told President Byrd
It would cost money, but he said
okay.*
Consequently, the methodology
class—a seminar course—was
included in the Baltimore Cam­
pus, University College curricul­
um for the fall semester, 1950.
Mitchell, however, was not
pleased that ‘separate but equal*
accommodations had been ar­
ranged especially for him. In
Sept., 1950, he took his grievances
to court, and in “Mitchell
v. Byrd," he claimed that because
of his skin color he was being
“denied advantages of associa­
tion with other students.*
He was the only student regis­
tered for the methodology class
in Baltimore. He felt the crea­
tion of a “one-man seminar* un­
just.
In court, Ronald Bamford, Dean
of the Graduate School, testified
that, “there is no question that if
he (Mitchell) had been a white
man, he could have been assigned
as a student at College Park.
